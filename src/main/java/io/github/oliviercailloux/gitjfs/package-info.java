/**
 * Here are a few things I wonder about related to Java file systems. If you have some answers
 * please write to me.
 *
 * {@link java.nio.file.spi.FileSystemProvider#readSymbolicLink} does not document that it may throw
 * {@link java.nio.file.NoSuchFileException}, whereas this possible exception is mentioned in
 * similar methods. Is this an oversight? If not, what should this method throw when trying to read
 * a non existent path?
 * <p>
 * {@link java.nio.file.FileSystem#getRootDirectories()}: I have no idea why the Java Files API does
 * not want an IOException here.
