/**
 * An immutable commit, with author and committer information (name, email, date).
 * <p>
 * Note that authoring comes logically before committing but there is no guarantee that the author
 * date and committer date follow this ordering (and this class does not attempt to verify this):
 * because the dates are set by the client, manual tampering or incorrect clock may yield a
 * committer time earlier than author time. This is rare in practice, but happens. For example,
 * <a href=
 * "https://api.github.com/repos/checkstyle/checkstyle/commits/812b3416dcda571de5e6f7abd9d4e4c68c4dcdcf">this
 * commit</a> in the checkstyle project was authored at “2017-07-09T05:01:28Z” but committed (by
 * someone else) about twenty minutes earlier.
